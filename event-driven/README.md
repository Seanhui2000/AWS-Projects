## Building an event driven architecture in AWS

In this project, I will be designing and building an event driven architecture in AWS that waits for a function to be invoked and once fired, 
Lambda destinations will be asynchronously configured to send an event, or in this case execution record, that contains details about the request and response. 
This architecture will be utilizing AWS EventBridge, Step Functions, and AWS Lambda.
